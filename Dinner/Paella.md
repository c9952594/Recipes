Ingredients
1 Â½tbsp sunflower oil or vegetable oil
1 large onion, finely diced
2 red peppers, chopped
3 garlic cloves, crushed or finely grated
1tbsp smoked paprika
250g paella rice
125ml white wine (optional)
227g can chopped tomatoes
750ml Kallo vegetable stock
saffron (optional)
400g butter beans, or other beans such as cannellini
200g green beans or long-stem broccoli
2 lemons, 1 juiced and 1 cut into wedges

Method
STEP 1
Heat the oil in a large lidded frying pan over a medium heat and fry the onion for 5 mins. Add the peppers and cook for another 5 mins until the onion and pepper has softened. Stir in the garlic and cook for 1 min, then stir in the paprika and cook for 1 min.

STEP 2
Stir in the paella rice and cook for 2 mins. Pour over the white wine, if using, and cook for 2-3 mins to reduce. Add the chopped tomatoes, Kallo vegetable stock and saffron, if using.

STEP 3
Stir in the beans, then pour over the stock and bring to the boil. Reduce to a simmer and cook for 10 mins. You can stir it occasionally, if you like, but traditionally you want a crust to form on the bottom. After 10 mins, scatter the green beans or broccoli on top, place the lid on the pan and cook for 3-4 mins until the greens and rice are tender. Cook with the lid off for a few mins if the rice is still too wet. Remove from the heat, squeeze over the lemon juice and serve with lemon wedges on the side.
